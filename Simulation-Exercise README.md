# ðŸ§  Simulation Exercise â€“ Core Mechanisms in Social Systems

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **simulation-based exploration of fundamental mechanisms** in social systems, implemented in Python.  
The goal is to understand how **local interactions** between agents lead to **emergent macro-level patterns** such as consensus, polarization, and diffusion of behaviors.

Specifically, this exercise implements and compares:
- **Voter model** â€“ how opinions spread until consensus is reached.
- **Threshold adoption model** â€“ how innovations/behaviors diffuse through a population.
- **Network effects** â€“ how network structure (random, small-world, scale-free) influences dynamics.

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

### 1. Voter Model
- Agents start with binary opinions (0/1).
- At each step, a random agent adopts a random neighbor's opinion.
- Simulation stops when **consensus** is reached.

### 2. Threshold Model
- Agents adopt a behavior if the fraction of neighbors already adopting exceeds a threshold Î¸.
- Models **contagion-like behavior** such as innovation adoption.

### 3. Network Structures
- **ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi (Random)**
- **Wattsâ€“Strogatz (Small-World)**
- **BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert (Scale-Free)**

Comparing outcomes across these networks reveals how **structure shapes dynamics**.

## ðŸ“Š Example Results

| Model        | Metric                | Key Finding |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Voter Model | Consensus Time       | Scale-free networks converge slowest due to hub nodes. |
| Threshold   | Adoption Rate        | Lower thresholds â†’ faster adoption, but only in connected networks. |
| Mixed       | Opinion Diversity    | Small shocks keep diversity longer before consensus. |
